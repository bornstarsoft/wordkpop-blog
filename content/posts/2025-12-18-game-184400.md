November 2025 marked a significant downturn in the US gaming market, recording the worst hardware and physical game sales since tracking began 30 years ago. According to market research firm Circana, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, a stark contrast to the 1.4 million sold back in 1995. This decline is attributed to a combination of high average prices for new consoles and a decrease in consumer spending during what is typically a lucrative sales period.

With hardware spending plummeting to $695 milliona 27% drop from the previous yearit's clear that the gaming industry is facing challenges. The average price for a new console reached an all-time high of $439, which likely deterred many potential buyers. Interestingly, the PlayStation 5 emerged as the best-selling console, while the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S followed closely behind.

In addition to hardware woes, physical software sales also took a hit, falling 14% compared to November 2024. This trend raises questions about the future of physical game sales, especially as digital purchases continue to dominate the market. As we look ahead, will console manufacturers find a way to lower prices, or are we witnessing a fundamental shift in how consumers engage with gaming?
