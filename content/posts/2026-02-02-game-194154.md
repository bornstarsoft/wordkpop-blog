In a significant move, Respawn Entertainment has announced that the Nintendo Switch version of Apex Legends will be shutting down on August 4, 2026. This decision comes as the game transitions to the new Nintendo Switch 2, marking the end of an era for players who have enjoyed the game on the original Switch since its port in 2021. Players will need to upgrade to the Switch 2 to retain their in-game currency, as any currency earned or purchased on the Switch will not transfer to other platforms.

As we approach the final update in Season 29, players are encouraged to either spend their Apex Coins before the shutdown or make the switch to the new console to keep their balance intact. While cross-progression exists for items bought on other platforms, currency remains exclusive to the Switch, making this a crucial time for players to strategize their next moves.

Respawn's commitment to enhancing the gaming experience on the Switch 2 is evident, and the community's support has been invaluable throughout this journey. As we look forward to the new features and improvements, how do you feel about this transition? Will you be making the leap to the Switch 2?
