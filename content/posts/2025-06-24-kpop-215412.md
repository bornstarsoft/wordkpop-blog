In a shocking turn of events, Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the much-anticipated game MindsEye, has reportedly initiated mass layoff proceedings that could affect over 100 employees. This news comes on the heels of a rocky launch for MindsEye, which has been plagued by technical issues and bugs, leading to widespread player dissatisfaction and even refunds from PlayStationâ€”a rare occurrence in the gaming world.

The Edinburgh-based studio has begun a 45-day consultation period, a legal requirement in the UK when planning to lay off 100 or more employees. With an estimated 300 staff based in the UK and an additional 200 overseas, the implications of these layoffs could be significant for the studio's future. The gaming community is left to wonder how this will impact ongoing support for MindsEye and the studio's reputation in an industry that is already highly competitive and scrutinized.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, the fate of Build a Rocket Boy serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by developers in delivering quality experiences to players. Will they be able to recover from this setback and regain the trust of their audience? Only time will tell.
