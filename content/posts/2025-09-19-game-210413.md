The upcoming horror puzzle game oneway.exe is set to launch on October 7, and it promises to deliver a unique blend of psychological thrills and interactive storytelling. Developed by Disordered Media, this first-person single-player experience invites players to explore a haunting digital environment that mirrors a malfunctioning operating system, where the lines between reality and the virtual world blur in chilling ways.

Players will navigate through the eerie halls of UNTITLED.EXE, uncovering the dark backstory of three developers whose lives took a tragic turn. With an ensemble cast of eight characters inspired by unsettling internet lore, oneway.exe challenges players to confront their own fears and unravel the mysteries hidden within the games code. Each chapter will delve deeper into the narrative, offering multiple paths and endings that enhance replayability.

As we await the launch, the anticipation builds around how this innovative game will redefine the horror genre by merging digital exploration with psychological depth. Are you ready to face the horrors lurking in the code?
