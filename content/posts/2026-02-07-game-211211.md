In a significant move to enhance its global presence, JetSynthesys has acquired EverMerge, a top-grossing merge puzzle game that has amassed over $350 million in lifetime revenue. This acquisition not only strengthens JetSynthesys' portfolio but also marks a pivotal step in its strategy to create a worldwide gaming ecosystem. EverMerge, known for its engaging mechanics and broad demographic appeal, has consistently ranked among the top 100 highest-grossing mobile games, showcasing its potential for sustained success.

Rajan Navani, Chairman & MD of JetSynthesys, emphasized the importance of this acquisition in bridging global intellectual properties with local insights. The company aims to leverage its expertise in community engagement to introduce EverMerge to emerging markets, particularly India. With plans to invest in the game's content and user experience, JetSynthesys is poised to keep the gameplay fresh and engaging for its growing player base.
