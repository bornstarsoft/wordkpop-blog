Square Enix's recent video comparing the Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade with its counterparts on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC has sparked significant interest among gamers. The video showcases the opening sequence of the game, revealing that despite the Switch 2's lower power, it manages to deliver impressive visual quality that can stand toe-to-toe with more powerful consoles.

One of the standout insights from the video is the emphasis on lighting as a critical factor in maintaining graphical fidelity. Naoki Hamaguchi, the game's director, noted that compromising on lighting could detract from character expressions and overall game quality. Instead, the team focused on optimizing other aspects, such as fog and post-processing effects, allowing the Switch 2 version to run smoothly at 30 frames per second without looking significantly inferior to the PS5 version.

As we look forward to the game's release on January 22, it's exciting to see how developers are pushing the boundaries of what handheld consoles can achieve. Will the Switch 2's capabilities redefine expectations for portable gaming graphics?
