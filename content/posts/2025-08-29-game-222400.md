In a surprising revelation, CD Projekt has announced that over 75% of Cyberpunk 2077's sales on the Nintendo Switch 2 were for the physical version. This statistic highlights a significant trend in gaming, where physical copies continue to hold strong appeal, even in an increasingly digital world. The Ultimate Edition of the game launched alongside the Switch 2 hardware in June, and it has quickly become the best-selling third-party title on the platform.

The success of Cyberpunk 2077 on the Switch 2 is particularly noteworthy given the ongoing debate around Game Key Cards, which have been criticized for offering only digital activation without any game data. Unlike many third-party titles that have opted for this model, Cyberpunk 2077 stands out as a full cartridge release, which likely contributed to its strong physical sales. CD Projekt's joint-CEO, Micha Nowakowski, emphasized their strategy of delivering high-quality products to a broad audience, and this launch exemplifies that commitment.

As we look to the future of gaming, it's fascinating to consider how the balance between physical and digital sales will evolve. Will more developers follow CD Projekt's lead and prioritize physical releases, or will the convenience of digital downloads ultimately prevail? The gaming community is eager to see how this dynamic unfolds.
