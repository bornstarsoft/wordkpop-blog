Microsoft has announced yet another price increase for its Xbox consoles in the United States, just five months after the last hike. This latest adjustment, effective October 3, reflects the company's response to changes in the macroeconomic environment, impacting gamers across the nation.

The Xbox Series S and X models will see price increases ranging from $20 to $70, with the Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Edition now priced at a staggering $799.99. This price point not only surpasses its previous increases but also positions it above the PlayStation 5 Pro, which offers similar storage capacity. Interestingly, Microsoft has confirmed that prices for controllers and headsets will remain unchanged, providing a small relief amidst the rising costs of consoles.

As gamers weigh their options, the question remains: will these price hikes deter potential buyers, or will the demand for next-gen gaming continue to thrive despite the increased costs?
