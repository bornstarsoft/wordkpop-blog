In a surprising move, indie horror game Haus Of Irndrous is currently available for free on Steam, but this offer will soon come to an end as the game transitions to a paid model on July 19, 2025. Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric title has garnered attention since its early access launch in August 2024, and players now have a limited window to claim it at no cost before it adopts a $1.99 price tag.

The decision to monetize the game is primarily aimed at funding future chapters and enhancing server support, as stated by the developers. This shift from a free-to-play model to a paid one is not entirely uncommon on Steam, but it does raise questions about how such changes affect player engagement and the overall gaming landscape. With the release of update 17.0, which includes significant improvements and optimizations, players are encouraged to provide feedback that will shape the game's future.

As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how this transition impacts the player community and the development of Haus Of Irndrous. Will the new pricing model attract a broader audience, or will it deter potential players? Only time will tell.
