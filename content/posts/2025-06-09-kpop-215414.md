The excitement is palpable as the demo for **Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4** is now available for players who pre-ordered the game. This demo allows fans to skate through The Foundry level from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and College from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, offering a nostalgic yet fresh experience. Players can choose to skate as iconic characters like Tony Hawk, Rayssa Leal, and the Doomslayerâ€”though the latter is exclusive to those who opted for the digital deluxe version.

In addition to the classic levels, the game promises to deliver new content, including three brand-new levels: Water Park, Pinball, and Movie Studio. This remake, developed by Iron Galaxy, not only revives beloved gameplay but also introduces exciting new features that cater to both long-time fans and newcomers alike. Furthermore, the inclusion of Michelangelo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as a playable skater adds a fun twist that fans are sure to appreciate.

With the official release set for July 11, 2025, and early access for deluxe editions starting on July 8, the anticipation continues to build. As Tony Hawk himself advocates for the revival of the Underground series, one can only wonder what other surprises the franchise has in store for its dedicated community. Are you ready to hit the ramps and relive the skateboarding glory days?
