In November 2025, the livestreaming landscape in China was significantly shaped by anime-style RPGs, showcasing their immense popularity and viewer engagement. According to Niko Partners' China Games & Livestreaming Tracker, titles like Kuro Games *Wuthering Waves* and miHoYos *Zenless Zone Zero* not only topped the charts but also demonstrated remarkable month-over-month viewership growth, driven by major updates and events.

*Kuro Games Wuthering Waves* saw a staggering 103% increase in viewership, reaching 36.5 million, while *Zenless Zone Zero* attracted 30.9 million viewers, marking an 84% rise. These spikes were largely fueled by well-timed livestreams that coincided with significant game updates, highlighting the critical role of platforms like Bilibili in connecting developers with their audience.

The success of these titles underscores the importance of strategic content releases and community engagement in the gaming industry. As we look to the future, it will be fascinating to see how these trends evolve and what new titles will capture the attention of viewers next.
