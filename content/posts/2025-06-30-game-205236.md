Nintendo has officially announced that Drag x Drive will be launching exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14, 2025, priced at $30 AUD. This game is particularly exciting as it utilizes the Joy-Con controllers in mouse mode, allowing players to control a wheelchair in a unique 3-on-3 basketball format. This innovative approach not only makes the game accessible but also adds a layer of interactivity that is sure to engage players of all abilities.

Having had the chance to play Drag x Drive for about thirty minutes at the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in Melbourne, I was genuinely surprised by how well the mouse controls functioned. The gameplay was far more exhilarating than I anticipated from the initial reveal video. It’s clear that Nintendo is pushing the boundaries of gaming accessibility, making it possible for a wider audience to enjoy the thrill of competitive sports gaming.

As we look forward to its release, one can’t help but wonder: will Drag x Drive set a new standard for accessibility in gaming? Let’s discuss in the comments below!
