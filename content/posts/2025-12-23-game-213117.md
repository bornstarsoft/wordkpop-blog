The Octopath Traveler series has officially surpassed an impressive milestone of 6 million units sold across its titles, according to a recent announcement from Square Enix. This figure combines both physical shipments and digital downloads from the original Octopath Traveler, its sequel, and the newly released Octopath Traveler 0. This growth is particularly notable, given that just a year ago, the series celebrated reaching 5 million units sold.

The first game in the series has been a standout success, with over 3 million units sold as of September 2022, while Octopath Traveler II gained significant traction, hitting 1 million sales by June 2023. To celebrate this achievement, Square Enix is offering a 60% discount on the first two games during the holiday season, making it an excellent time for new players to dive into this beloved RPG franchise.

As we look ahead, the continued popularity of the Octopath Traveler series raises questions about what new adventures and innovations Square Enix might bring to the table. Will we see more expansions or entirely new titles in the future? Only time will tell.
