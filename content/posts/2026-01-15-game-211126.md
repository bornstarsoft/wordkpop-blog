In a surprising revelation, a player has discovered that installing all downloadable content (DLC) for Monster Hunter Wilds on PC can significantly enhance game performance. According to Reddit user de_Tylmarande, the game experiences drastic frame rate improvements when all DLC is present, suggesting that the games aggressive DLC ownership checks may be the culprit behind performance issues for players without the additional content.

After conducting tests on different accountsone with the base game and another with all DLCde_Tylmarande noted that the account lacking DLC suffered from severe frame rate drops, while the account with full DLC enjoyed smooth gameplay. This led to the hypothesis that the games frequent checks for DLC presence are taxing the system, causing the performance dips. To test this theory further, the player created a mod that bypasses these checks, resulting in a remarkable boost in frame rates without any hardware upgrades.

This discovery raises important questions about how game developers manage performance and content checks. If Capcom can address this issue, it could lead to a smoother experience for many players on Steam, where the game currently holds a mixed user review score. Will we see a patch that resolves these performance issues, or will players have to resort to unofficial mods to enjoy the game as intended?
