In a surprising turn of events, Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will be shutting down permanently on January 31, 2027. This announcement comes after the game was pulled from storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store, marking the end of an era for players who have invested time and resources into this virtual world. With the game no longer available for purchase starting January 15, 2026, the countdown has begun for fans to enjoy their last year in Aeternum.

The decision to cease operations follows Amazon's broader strategy shift away from MMO development, which has been further complicated by significant layoffs within the company. In a heartfelt message to the community, Amazon expressed gratitude for the dedication and passion of its players, emphasizing the unique journey they shared together in crafting the world of Aeternum. Players will still be able to access the game they purchased, but the experience will come to a close next year, leaving many to reflect on their adventures.

As we approach this final chapter, it raises questions about the future of MMO gaming and the impact of corporate decisions on beloved titles. Will we see a resurgence of interest in other MMOs, or will this mark a shift in player engagement? Only time will tell as we prepare to bid farewell to New World: Aeternum and the memories it has created.
