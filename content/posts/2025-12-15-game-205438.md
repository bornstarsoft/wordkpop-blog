Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, originally developed by Chris Oberth in 1991, is making a comeback thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100, not only revives a piece of gaming history but also supports vital archival efforts that preserve the legacy of 8-bit gaming. The release includes an authentic NES cartridge and a detailed manual that chronicles the game's troubled past and Oberth's career, highlighting the broader challenges of preserving video game history.

The resurrection of Xcavator is a significant moment for retro gaming enthusiasts and collectors alike. It showcases the importance of preserving our digital heritage and the stories behind the games we love. As we look forward to the 2025 release, one can't help but wonder what other lost gems might still be waiting to be uncovered in the vast archives of gaming history.
