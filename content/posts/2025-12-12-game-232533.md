The recently announced puzzle game, *Order of the Sinking Star*, from Jonathan Blow and Thekla Inc, promises to redefine the genre with its innovative mechanics and expansive gameplay. With a staggering 1,430 puzzles, this game is designed not just to challenge players but to immerse them in a richly crafted world where every puzzle intertwines with the narrative of a queen on the run.

Set in a fantastical realm, players will navigate through four distinct worlds, each introducing unique mechanics that build upon traditional puzzle-solving. From manipulating boulders to using magical mirrors, the game encourages exploration and creativity, reminiscent of Blow's previous works like *The Witness* and *Braid*. The non-linear exploration means that players can engage with the game at their own pace, making it accessible for both casual gamers and hardcore puzzle enthusiasts.

As we look forward to its release in 2026, the anticipation is palpable. Will *Order of the Sinking Star* set a new standard for puzzle games, or will it be another title lost in the sea of releases? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: its shaping up to be a must-play for fans of the genre.
