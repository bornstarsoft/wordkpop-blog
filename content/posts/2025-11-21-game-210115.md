The 2025 Golden Joystick Awards showcased the incredible talent within the gaming industry, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 emerging as the standout title of the night. Winning a total of seven awards, including the coveted Ultimate Game of the Year, this role-playing game from Sandfall Interactive not only captivated players but also set a high bar for storytelling and visual design in gaming.

The accolades didn't stop there; the performances of Jennifer English and Ben Starr were recognized with awards for Best Lead Performer and Best Supporting Performer, respectively. Sandfall Interactive was also honored as Studio of the Year, marking a significant achievement for this breakout studio. With such a strong showing, Clair Obscur is poised to influence the gaming landscape in the coming years.
