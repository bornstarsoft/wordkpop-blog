In a recent announcement, Gearbox has confirmed that the standard edition of Borderlands 4 will be priced at $70, quelling fears that it might hit the $80 mark. This decision comes after some controversial comments from CEO Randy Pitchford, who suggested that "real fans" would find a way to pay higher prices for games. The confirmation of a $70 price point is a relief for many gamers who are already facing rising costs in the gaming industry.

Alongside the standard edition, Gearbox will offer a $130 Super Deluxe Edition and a $150 Collectorâ€™s Edition, which intriguingly does not include the game itself. The company has also promised a wealth of post-launch content, including new characters, regions, and story missions, which will be available through both free and paid DLC. This approach not only enhances the game's value but also indicates Gearbox's commitment to keeping players engaged long after the initial release.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve with increasing development costs, it's refreshing to see a major studio like Gearbox prioritize affordability for its fanbase. With a release date set for September 12, 2025, many are left wondering how the game will perform in a competitive market. Will the value proposition hold up against the rising expectations of gamers?
