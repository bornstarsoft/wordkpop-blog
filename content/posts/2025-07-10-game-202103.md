In light of recent layoffs at Microsoft, Rare is set to discuss the future of its flagship game, Sea of Thieves, in an upcoming community direct. This event, scheduled for Thursday at 3 PM UK / 10 AM ET, promises to unveil insights into the next two Seasons of the game and significant changes to the Insider Programme. With the departure of key figures like Gregg Mayles and Louise OConnor, the community is eager to see how these changes will shape the game's trajectory.

The announcement comes on the heels of Microsofts sweeping layoffs, which reportedly affected around 9,100 employees, including several from Rare. The cancellation of the much-anticipated Everwild project has left many wondering about the future direction of the studio. As Rare navigates these turbulent waters, fans are hopeful that the upcoming community direct will provide clarity and excitement for what lies ahead in Sea of Thieves.

As we look forward to the community direct, it raises the question: how will Rare adapt and innovate in the face of these challenges? Will the changes lead to a revitalization of Sea of Thieves, or will it signal a shift in the studio's focus? Only time will tell.
