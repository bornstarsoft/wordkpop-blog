Square Enix has officially announced that the highly anticipated Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake will be making its way to the Nintendo Switch 2, but with a twist: it will be available as a Game-Key Card. This decision has sparked discussions among gamers and industry observers, especially considering the growing trend of digital game distribution and its implications for game preservation.

Set to launch on October 30 alongside other platforms like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, the Switch 2 version's Game-Key Card format raises questions about the future of physical media in gaming. While the original Switch version will be available on a cartridge, the Game-Key Card system has been criticized by preservationists who view it as a step backward for the industry. With most third-party titles for the Switch 2 adopting this format, it’s clear that the gaming landscape is evolving, albeit in ways that may not please everyone.

In addition to the standard release, a Collector’s Edition priced at $149.99 will be available exclusively through the Square Enix store, featuring a physical copy of the game, acrylic figures, and digital content. Players who have save data from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake will also receive exclusive in-game items, adding an extra incentive for long-time fans of the series. As we look forward to the release, one can’t help but wonder how this shift in distribution will affect the gaming community and the future of game collections.
