The anticipation surrounding the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium game reveal for December 2025 is palpable, especially with the recent announcement of Assassin's Creed Mirage joining the line-up. This month, subscribers can look forward to an exciting array of titles, including Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and Granblue Fantasy: Relink, expanding the gaming experience for both PS4 and PS5 users.

As the gaming community eagerly awaits the official announcement on December 10, predictions are rife on platforms like Reddit. Fans are speculating about potential additions, with titles like Resident Evil 4 Remake and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora making the rounds. With the current line-up set to drop on December 16, gamers are keen to see if these predictions hold water.

However, it's also crucial to note the games that will be leaving the service, such as Battlefield 2042 and Forspoken, making this a pivotal moment for players to catch up on titles before they vanish. As we approach the reveal date, one can't help but wonder: what surprises does Sony have in store for us this month?
