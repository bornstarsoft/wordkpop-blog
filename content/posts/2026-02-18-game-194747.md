Nintendo has officially launched its Virtual Boy app on Switch Online, allowing players to dive into a selection of games from one of the company's most infamous consoles. The app, titled Nintendo Classics, is now available for download on the Switch and Switch 2 eShop, but players will need a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership to access these nostalgic titles.

At launch, the app features seven games, including classics like 3D Tetris and Virtual Boy Wario Land. For those looking to enhance their experience, a physical Virtual Boy accessory is available for purchase, with prices ranging from $25 for a cardboard viewer to $100 for a replica console. With plans to add nine more games in the future, including Mario Clash and the unreleased Zero Racer, players will soon have access to the majority of the Virtual Boy library.

As Nintendo continues to expand its offerings, it raises an intriguing question: how will the revival of these retro games influence the gaming landscape today? Will nostalgia drive a new wave of interest in classic gaming, or will it simply be a fleeting moment for dedicated fans?
