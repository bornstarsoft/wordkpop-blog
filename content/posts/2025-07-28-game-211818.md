A new video game based on the iconic Friday the 13th franchise is officially in development, igniting excitement among fans of horror gaming. During a recent San Diego Comic-Con panel, Robert Barsamian, executive vice president at Horror Inc, revealed that both a sequel game and a new movie are in the works, marking a significant return for the franchise that has been dormant for over a decade.

While details remain scarce, Barsamian hinted that the upcoming game may or may not be a direct follow-up to the 2017 title, Friday the 13th: The Game. This previous installment, which was pulled from sale after its license expired, was well-received for its asymmetrical multiplayer gameplay, allowing players to step into the shoes of either Jason Voorhees or camp counselors. The anticipation surrounding this new project is palpable, especially given the franchise's rich history and the recent resurgence of interest in horror-themed games.

As fans await more news, the establishment of Jason Universe signals a commitment to revitalizing the Friday the 13th brand through various media. Will this new game capture the essence of what made its predecessor a hit? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the world of horror gaming is about to get a thrilling new chapter.
