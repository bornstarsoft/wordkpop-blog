In a significant turn of events for fans of the puzzle game Humanity, Enhance Games has announced that it will be discontinuing online services for the game by the end of March 2026. This decision comes after a noticeable decline in user engagement, particularly concerning the stage-sharing feature that allowed players to upload and share their custom levels. While the game has seen an impressive community contribution of over 30,000 user-created stages, the studio has opted to focus resources elsewhere as the service becomes less viable.

As of now, players can still enjoy the stages they have created and saved locally, but the ability to share new content will soon be a thing of the past. This move raises questions about the sustainability of online features in single-player focused games and whether the community-driven content model can thrive in the long run. 

What are your thoughts on this decision? Have you enjoyed playing community-made stages in Humanity, or do you think the game can still thrive without its online features?
