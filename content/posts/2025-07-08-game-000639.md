As the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy 9 approaches, excitement is building around reports of a potential remake in development by Square Enix. The recent anniversary video showcases iconic scenes from the beloved PS1 RPG, reigniting hopes that fans may soon experience this classic in a modern format. With the success of the Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy, many are eager to see how Square Enix would breathe new life into FF9.

The speculation surrounding a remake gained traction following a 2021 leak from the GeForce Now database, which hinted at several unannounced titles, including FF9. While no official announcement has been made, multiple sources have indicated that the project is indeed in the works. Square Enixs Naoki Yoshida hinted that a remake could be too expansive for a single game, suggesting a multi-part series similar to FF7.

Originally released in 2000, Final Fantasy 9 has remained a fan favorite, celebrated for its rich storytelling and memorable characters. As we look forward to what Square Enix has in store, the question remains: how will they honor the legacy of this classic while appealing to a new generation of gamers?
