After over 20 years in the gaming industry, I am thrilled to announce a personal milestone: my name is now listed in the credits of a video game! This moment has been a long time coming, as Ive spent decades writing about games, influencing titles, and contributing to the gaming community. However, being credited in a game has always been on my bucket list, and Im excited to share that it has finally happened with the indie title AHRO.

AHRO, developed by OEH Interactive, is an experimental game that emphasizes deep lore without combat. I had the privilege of assisting with quality assurance and promoting the free v2.0 launch, which just went live on November 25, 2025, across multiple platforms including Steam, Switch, Linux, and Atari VCS. Seeing my name in the credits not once, but twice, is an incredible honor and a testament to the unique vision of this game.

This experience has reignited my passion for game development and storytelling. I look forward to what the future holds and hope to inspire others in the gaming community to pursue their dreams, no matter how big or small. Have you ever had a similar milestone in your career?
