This recognition not only highlights the innovative gameplay and design of these titles but also marks a significant moment for the newly launched Switch 2, showcasing its potential to compete with heavyweights like *Death Stranding 2* and *Ghost of Ytei*.

In addition to their nominations for the top honor, *Mario Kart World* is also vying for 'Best Multiplayer Game', while *Donkey Kong Bananza* is in the running for 'Best Audio Design'.
