In an impressive display of popularity, Battlefield 6 has shattered EA's previous concurrent player record on Steam, reaching a staggering peak of 747,440 players during its launch weekend. This remarkable achievement not only surpasses the former record held by Apex Legends but also marks Battlefield 6 as the 14th highest peak in Steam's history.

The game's success is particularly notable given EA's limited presence on Steam until late 2019, when they began releasing titles like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Since then, EA has steadily built its library on the platform, and now Battlefield 6 stands as the undisputed record holder for concurrent players among EA titles on Steam. This milestone highlights the growing trend of players flocking to popular franchises and the increasing competition in the gaming industry.

As we look ahead, it will be fascinating to see how Battlefield 6 continues to engage its player base and whether it can maintain this momentum in the weeks to come. Will it inspire other titles to push for higher player counts, or will it set a new standard for future releases?
