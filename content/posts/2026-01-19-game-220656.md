As we approach 2026, SEGA is gearing up for a double celebration of two iconic franchises: Sonic the Hedgehog and Puyo Puyo. While Sonic's 35th anniversary has already made waves, the announcement of Puyo Puyo's own milestone brings a fresh wave of excitement for fans. The Dairensa! project, named after a beloved song from the puzzle series, promises a plethora of events and initiatives that will engage both new and longtime players alike.

The festivities kick off with a special live stream on February 1, 2026, featuring voice actors and exclusive game demos. Additionally, pop-up stores across Japan will showcase limited-edition merchandise, allowing fans to immerse themselves in the Puyo Puyo universe. With collaborations between Sonic and Puyo Puyo on the horizon, this anniversary is shaping up to be a remarkable celebration of gaming history.

As SEGA continues to unveil more details, one can't help but wonder: what surprises do they have in store for us? Will this be the year we see a resurgence of classic gaming experiences?
