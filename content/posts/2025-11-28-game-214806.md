In the world of game development, the term "ghost developer" often refers to companies that work behind the scenes, creating beloved titles without receiving the credit they deserve. Tose, a prominent Japanese contractor, has emerged as a key player in this arena, with recent reports highlighting that Atlus and Square Enix were its biggest clients in the past fiscal year. Atlus accounted for a remarkable 22.3% of Tose's total revenue, solidifying its position as a top collaborator for the second consecutive year.

Tose's extensive history in the gaming industry dates back to 1979, and its portfolio includes notable projects like the Dragon Quest I & II HD-2D Remake and Tales of Graces f Remastered. While the company has worked with major publishers such as Nintendo and Bandai Namco, its lack of visibility in credits has led to a unique reputation. The recent surge in revenue from Square Enix, which jumped to 16.9% this year, indicates a growing reliance on Tose's expertise, especially as the gaming landscape continues to evolve.

As the gaming industry becomes increasingly competitive, the role of ghost developers like Tose may become more significant. How will this impact the future of game development and the recognition of those who contribute to our favorite titles?
