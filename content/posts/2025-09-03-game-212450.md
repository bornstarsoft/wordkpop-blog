Nintendo has just announced that Forsaken 64 will be the 40th Nintendo 64 game added to its Switch Online library, a significant milestone for retro gaming enthusiasts. Set to launch on September 4, this first-person shooter from 1998 is making its way to the Nintendo 64 Mature 17+ app, alongside other classics like Perfect Dark and Turok. This move not only expands the library of mature-rated games but also highlights Nintendo's commitment to preserving its gaming history.

Forsaken 64 is notable for its unique gameplay mechanics, allowing players to pilot a ship through intricate stages without the constraints of gravity. This freedom can lead to disorientation, making it a distinctive experience compared to other FPS titles of its time. Additionally, the game is remembered for its bizarre box art, which diverged from typical representations of gameplay. As we await its release, it's exciting to think about how this addition will resonate with both nostalgic players and newcomers alike.

With Forsaken 64 joining the ranks of classic titles, one can't help but wonder what other hidden gems Nintendo might unveil in the future. Will we see more mature-rated games making their way to Switch Online? The anticipation is palpable as we look forward to more retro revivals in the gaming landscape.
