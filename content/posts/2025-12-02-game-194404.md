Starting today, VGC is launching an exciting Patreon Christmas pledge drive aimed at enriching our festive content and providing amazing rewards for our community. By participating at Patreon.com/VideoGamesChronicle, you can help fund some of our most-requested future videos, shows, and more, while also unlocking exclusive bonuses as we reach our goals.

Throughout December, every new, gifted, or upgraded membership will contribute points towards our overall total. As this total increases, we will unveil stretch goals that include deep dives into our magazine archives, special guest appearances, and commentary tracks for classic video game movies. If we hit our highest goal, well even share plans for a special celebration of the site and the VGC Podcast!

The content unlocked during this drive will be available throughout December and early January, ensuring your holiday season is packed with VGC goodness. So, are you ready to join us in making this festive season unforgettable for the gaming community?
