Wilmot Works It Out offers a refreshing twist on the puzzle genre, transforming the often stressful experience of jigsaw puzzles into a laid-back adventure. Unlike its predecessor, Wilmot’s Warehouse, which challenged players with frantic organization tasks, this sequel invites you into a serene world where you help the charming character Wilmot piece together surreal images at a leisurely pace. The game’s unique setup, where players engage in a dialogue with a delivery person while assembling puzzles, adds a delightful narrative layer that enhances the overall experience.

As you progress through the game, you’ll receive various puzzle pieces that need to be arranged to complete whimsical designs. The beauty of Wilmot Works It Out lies in its simplicity; while the puzzles are never overwhelmingly difficult, they require a bit of creativity and spatial reasoning, making it an enjoyable challenge for players of all ages. This makes it a perfect game for family gaming sessions, where passing the controller around can lead to shared laughter and fun.

Whether you’re playing solo or with friends and family, Wilmot Works It Out stands out as a light-hearted puzzle game that runs smoothly on both the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. Its charming visuals and engaging gameplay make it a must-try for anyone looking to unwind with a puzzle game that’s as delightful as it is entertaining. Will you join Wilmot on this relaxing puzzle journey?
