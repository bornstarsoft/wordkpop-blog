In a recent discussion at the G-Star game developer convention, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii expressed his interest in integrating AI chatbots into future games. He envisions a unique gaming experience where players can solve mysteries or engage in quiz games with an AI-powered virtual partner, enhancing interactivity and immersion.

Horii's admiration for AI, particularly ChatGPT, highlights its potential to revolutionize gameplay. He imagines scenarios where players could interrogate AI characters or collaborate with them to uncover clues, making the gaming experience more dynamic and engaging. This innovative approach could redefine how narratives are constructed in video games, merging storytelling with real-time conversation.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the integration of AI could lead to transformative experiences that blur the lines between reality and virtual worlds. What do you think about the future of AI in gaming? Could it change the way we interact with our favorite characters forever?
