Peter Molyneux, the visionary behind the original Fable series, recently shared his heartfelt reaction to the gameplay reveal of the reboot by Playground Games. In an interview with IGN, he admitted to tearing up while watching the trailer, expressing a profound sense of nostalgia and pride. Molyneux articulated that seeing the world he helped create continue to thrive brought him immense joy, stating, "This thing that we created, its going to live, its going to carry on."

While Molyneux praised Playground's decision to retell the Fable story rather than continue from where the original games left off, he did offer some constructive criticism. He noted a slight "antiseptic feel" to the visuals, suggesting that the chaotic charm of the original Fable universe could be enhanced. Despite this, his excitement for the new installment remains palpable, as he looks forward to immersing himself in the beloved world once again. 

As we anticipate the release of this new chapter in the Fable saga, one can't help but wonder: will Playground Games capture the essence of what made the original so beloved? The gaming community is eager to find out.
