Croc Studio Argonaut has reignited interest in the gaming community with its plans to potentially remaster the cult classic, Buck Bumble. Co-CEO Mike Arkin expressed hope that the beloved third-person shooter, originally released on the Nintendo 64 in 1998, will eventually see a modern revival. This news comes on the heels of the studio's successful remaster of Croc: Legend of the Gobbos, which has set a positive precedent for future projects.

While fans are eager for Buck Bumble's return, it appears Argonaut will first focus on remastering Croc 2, as they gauge the market's response to their latest release. The studio's commitment to quality is evident, with early research and development already underway to ensure a successful remastering approach. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, the anticipation surrounding Buck Bumble's potential comeback raises questions about how remastered classics can capture the hearts of both nostalgic fans and new players alike.
