The recent launch of Stellar Blade on PC has made waves in the gaming community, as it becomes the second PlayStation-published title to surpass 100,000 concurrent players on Steam. With an impressive peak of 100,904 players, Stellar Blade is carving out its place in the competitive landscape of online gaming, showcasing the growing popularity of PlayStation titles on PC platforms.

This milestone is particularly noteworthy as it highlights the success of cross-platform releases, allowing PlayStation games to reach a broader audience.
